Evalurate applies institutional investment and risk methodologies in combination with machine learning methods to produce an objective and independent assessment of expected loan performance.
                                        Evalurate Score and Location Score are assessments of the quality of the loan and the location in which the relevant property is located to give you a fair and objective assessment of risk related to this proposition.
